# Hey :wave:

I'm Allan. A software developer interested in web dev, LLMs and their uses.
Currently working at **Deloitte AI&Data** in Madrid. At the moment, I'm mostly focused on developing new web apps and interfaces with Angular. In my free time, I like to toy around with LLM, mostly through available APIs and see what's possible with them.
